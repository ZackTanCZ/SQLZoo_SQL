## Question 2 - Check out per floor. 
The first digit of the room number indicates the floor â€“ e.g. room 201 is on the 2nd floor.\
For each day of the week beginning 2016-11-14 show how many rooms are being vacated that day by floor number.\
Show all days in the correct order.

This question is pretty hard but this is the approach\
1. Compute a table and find every distinct **THURSDAY** within Nov 2016, Dec 2016 (Table A)\
2. Compute table with the final rooms charges (nights * rates + extra rates) & Checkout dates (Table B)\
3. Join both tables with the business logic - Catergorise each **CheckOutDate** into their week (which begins with the previous friday & present thursday)\
4. Group all the transaction into their week and sum the final room charges.\

The above SQL query is correct (Syntax wise) but the logic is WIP.
